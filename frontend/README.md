ðŸš§ This project is currently under progress. ðŸš§

## learning goals

Through this project, I'll be practicing and learning more about integrating APIs with a React app using Express.js. I'll be leveraging The Movie Database (TMDB) API for movie related data. 

You can explore the TMDB API documentation at [TMDB API Documentation](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs).
